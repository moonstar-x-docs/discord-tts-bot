# /say

!!! info "Aliases"
    You can also use the following as an alias for this command:

    * `/s`

## üìñ Description

Send a Text-to-Speech message in your voice channel with your own settings or the ones saved for this server.

You can configure your own TTS provider by using the [/set_my_provider](../config/set-my-provider.md) command and change its settings (if applies) with the appropriate command. For example, for the [Google Translate Provider](../../text-to-speech-providers/google-translate.md) you may run [/google_set_my](../google-tts/google-set-my.md), some providers may not have settings associated to them.

Similarly, if you wish to set the TTS provider to be used by default on your server (for people who have not set their own settings before), you may use the [/set_default_provider](../config/set-default-provider.md) command and follow the same logic with the *set_default* kind of command for the respective TTS provider.

If you insert a mention to a user, channel or role, the bot will read-out the name of the mentioned entity. Also, when using a custom emoji, the bot will read its name.

!!! warning "Keep in Mind"
    Regular emojis may be read differently depending on the TTS provider. Some providers may not support emojis altogether such as the [Aeiou Provider](../../text-to-speech-providers/aeiou.md).
