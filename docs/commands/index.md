# Introduction

This section contains a list of all the available commands for the bot, separated by sections.

!!! warning "Keep in Mind"
    In the official bot instance, the [TTS channel commands](./channel-tts/index.md) are not available. This is due to the fact that those commands require the `GUILD_MESSAGES` privileged intent, which is easily available to unverified bots. For verified bots (which is the case of the official bot), an application is necessary to justify the need to access this privileged intent.
