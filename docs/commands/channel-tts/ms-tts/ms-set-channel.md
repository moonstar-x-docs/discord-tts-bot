# /ms_set_channel

## 📖 Description

Sets the settings to be used by the message-only based TTS channel with the [Microsoft Provider (TTS Tool)](../../../text-to-speech-providers/microsoft-ttstool.md).

Run this command inside the channel you wish to change the settings for. Make sure to have set the TTS channel provider to [Microsoft Provider (TTS Tool)](../../../text-to-speech-providers/microsoft-ttstool.md) by running the [/set_channel_provider](../config/set-channel-provider.md) command inside the same channel.
